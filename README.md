# Game Theory Course Games
Collection of simulations I used for games in ECON 212: Game Theory at the University of Waterloo. You can find the link to this website here (once I have it up).

## How does this work?
One week after each game is given to us (typically the Friday after), I will publicize the simulations/tools I used to determine my strategy for that week.

This website will only be up until the end of the Fall 2022 term.
